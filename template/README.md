# IMA.js skeleton application

The IMA.js is an application development stack for developing isomorphic
applications written in pure JavaScript and React.

## Why we use IMA.js and you should too?

Here at [Seznam.cz](https://www.seznam.cz/vychytavky/), development of a frontend application comes with many checkboxes that need to be ticked off before the project goes public. Mainly because of a diverse audience and a challenging product requirements.

In order to **not** reinvent the wheel on every project and to address all of these problems (checkboxes) we created the IMA.js framework. Here are a few outlines that we're most proud of:

- [X] **Isomorphic** - application logic is first executed at the server-side, generates the page markup, and then when the application logic is executed at the client-side it automatically binds to the server-generated markup and acts like a single-page application (or a multi-page application if the client does not support JavaScript). This allows for fast load times, out-of-box support for web crawlers and greater overall user experienc (or UX for short).
- [X] **React compatible** - IMA.js Views extend the React Component and are in tight cooperation with our Controllers. That means you can use the full magic of React v16 without loosing anything.
- [X] **Production ready** - there's no need for additional setup or configuration. IMA.js uses evironment-specific configurations from the start.
- [X] **Battle tested** - IMA.js is used on various projects across Seznam.cz. Some of them pushing the limits of what a frontend application can do.

## Documentation

We have prepared a complex tutorial for you:
[Your first IMA.js application](https://github.com/seznam/IMA.js-skeleton/wiki/Tutorial,-part-1).
This tutorial covers the basics of creating isomorphic web applications using
IMA.js, but you will encounter some more advanced concepts in there as well.

For a more in-depth information about the IMA.js see a [full documentation](https://github.com/seznam/IMA.js-skeleton/wiki/Documentation).

## Main IMA.js parts
- [IMA core](https://github.com/seznam/IMA.js-core) - it contains base classes and common classes for every days work which allow you server side rendering and hydrating application in browser.
- [IMA server](https://github.com/seznam/IMA.js-server) - it contains methods which allow you connect IMA application with express framework.
- [IMA bundle](https://github.com/seznam/IMA.js-gulp-tasks) - IMA.js use for bundling and automatisation gulp. There are prepared common tasks and base configuration.
